## üìñ Overview

This is a repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [Flux](https://fluxcd.io), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## ‚õµ Kubernetes

There is a template over at [onedr0p/flux-cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template) if you wanted to try and follow along with some of the practices I use here.

### Installation

This semi hyper-converged cluster runs [Talos Linux](https://talos.dev), an immutable and ephemeral Linux distribution built for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), deployed on bare-metal Intel NUCs. [Rook](https://rook.io) then provides my workloads with persistent block, object, and file storage; while a seperate server provides file storage for my media.

üî∏ _[Click here](./infrastructure/talos/cluster-0/talconfig.yaml) to see my Talos configuration._

### Core Components

- [cilium](https://cilium.io): Internal Kubernetes networking plugin.
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io): Creates SSL certificates for services in my Kubernetes cluster.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically manages DNS records from my cluster in a cloud DNS provider.
- [external-secrets](https://external-secrets.io): Managed Kubernetes secrets using [Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/).
- [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx): Ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
- [rook](https://rook.io): Distributed block storage for peristent storage.
- [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops): Managed secrets for Kubernetes and Terraform which are commited to Git.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync): Backup and recovery of persistent volume claims.

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches the clusters in my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my clusters based on the state of my Git repository.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the `kubernetes` folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations. Those Flux kustomizations will generally have a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application underneath it which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged Flux applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
üìÅ k8s
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ cluster/cluster-0  # main cluster
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ crds         # custom resources
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ flux           # core flux configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ manifests      # applications
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ global/flux      # shared resources
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ repositories   # helm and git repositories
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ vars           # common variables
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ flux           # core flux configuration
```

### Flux Workflow

This is a high-level look how Flux deploys my applications with dependencies. Below there are 3 apps `postgres`, `authentik` and `weave-gitops`. `postgres` is the first app that needs to be running and healthy before `authentik` and `weave-gitops`. Once `postgres` is healthy `authentik` will be deployed and after that is healthy `weave-gitops` will be deployed.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are self-hosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.

The alternative solution to these two problems would be to host a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud and deploy applications like [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden)and [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/). However, maintaining another cluster and monitoring another group of workloads is a lot more time and effort than I am willing to put in.
