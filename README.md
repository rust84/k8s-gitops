## Overview

Leveraging [Sidero](https://github.com/siderolabs/sidero), [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) and [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) to automate my home clusters state using GitOps principles.

This repo is constantly evolving and the [documentation](https://rust84.github.io/k8s-gitops/) is currently a WIP.

## Thanks

The original inspiration for this repo came from [Jeff Billimek](https://github.com/billimek), and the awesome [k8s-at-home](https://discord.gg/sTMX7Vh) community.

You can find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sTMX7Vh) and a number of the members have shared their repos [here](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/awesome-home-kubernetes)
